      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Zoé Navarro, a young cinematographer based in Montreal.</p>
      <div class="image-grid">

      <p>Now located in Montreal, i grew up in France, in a little village of the Alps.</p>
      <p>There, i studied cinema for 3 years in my "audiovisuel" section in high school.</p>
      <p>While mostly studying how to create an image and how to write a scenario, i also tried relentlessly</p>
      <p>to make it as an actress ! Living in a village where i could count more sheeps than residents,</p>
      <p>you can imagine that it wasn't the easiest ! But i made it in the picture "28 degrès sous la lune"</p>
      <p>by Noé Mercklé in 2023, a month before taking the plane to montreal ! I am now in my 3rd year of a</p>
      <p>Bachelor in "Film Production" in the Mel Hoppenheim school of cinema at Concordia University.</p>
      <p>During those years, i have reinforced my knowledge in theorical aspects, such as the study of images</p>
      <p>and the history of films, as well as in practical aspects, thanks to the many films sets and productions</p>
      <p>that i was apart of (notably with the film "Between the silence and the noise" that was screened at the TPFF in Toronto).</p>
      <p>My goal now is to gain even more experience in this beautiful and florishing industry that is the cinéma Québécois !</p>
      <p>I would love to hear from you and it would be a pleasure to work along your side.</p>
      <p>Please feel free to write to me in my "contact" section and i will be back to you shortly.</p>
      <p>Looking forward to creating magic through our lenses :)</p>
